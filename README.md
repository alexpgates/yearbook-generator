# Yearbook Generator

Parse a photo CD provided by Scholastic and generate a simple PDF yearbook for your school.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- You'll need a local development environment with PHP 7.1. I recommend [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/valet)
- The app is built using the [Laravel PHP framework](https://github.com/laravel/) which currently requires PHP 7.1. PDF generation is handled using [Spatie](https://github.com/spatie/)'s excellent [Browsershot package](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot), which requires node 7.6.0 or higher and the Puppeteer Node library.

### Installing

- Clone the repository to your local environment
- Run `composer install`
- Update your `.env` file appropriately to reference your database settings
- run `php artisan migrate` to migrate your datbase tables
- run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies

### Generating your yearbook

- Copy the contents of your scholastic CD to the `storage/app/public/yearbook` directory
- run `php artisan yearbook:parse` - this will build the database with the Scholastic data
- in the `staff_members` directory, fill in appropriate prefix (Mrs. / Ms. / Mr. etc.) and title for each staff member.
- note `teacher_room` is used to determine which pages staff belong on. Any staff member (including the teacher) should have `teacher_room` set to the classroom teacher's last name. Staff members who belong on the staff page should have `teacher_room` set to _staff_.
- run `php artisan yearbook:generate` - this will generate PDFs for each classroom and save them in `/storage/generated-yearbook`

### Customizing your design

PDFs are generated by creating a PDF from a webpage using a headless browser. The layout file for classroom pages is located at `resources/views/classroom.show.blade.php`.

By default, this app is configured to use Bootstrap 4. You're free to use whichever framework you want, but you'll need to make the appropriate changes in Laravel and rebuilt your assets using `yarn run production`.

## Next steps

This app only creates individual PDFs for each page. You'll need to take the generated PDFs and combine them with any other yearbook pages + your cover.

## TODO

The number of columns on each page is hard-coded in the layout file, and I'm not super jazzed with how that all works. It'd be nice to make this easier to customize and less messy code-wise.

## Built With

* [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/) - Laravel PHP Framework
* [Browsershot](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot) - PDF generation from using a headless Chrome browser
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) - For page layout
